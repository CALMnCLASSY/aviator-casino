then also remove the total wins and total bet and replace it with a small affiliate button under the biggest win and best multiplier so we can now implement a simple referral system whereby each user gets a unique  promo code to invite their friends or other users to join the site. Tell them they get 50% of the company's profit which is the invited person's loss amount so on clicking the Affiliate Program button they are told about the referral and on joining the program I see them on the admin page so also improve the Â admin page to have a referral section where I can click on any affiliate to see their referred users 
So lets implement the person's unique promo code which they choose when they sign up for the affiliate program so this promo code is what makes the tracking easier...on the sign up form add a enter promo code input area which is hidden by default so they click on the enter promo code to expand the input area and this promo code is shared to my admin page and also updates to the affiliate's profile page in the affiliate program section so that they can also see their referred users number of deposits and total loss then also show them their total affiliate balance which they can withdraw to their main account balance 
so when the affiliate program button is pressed there is an option for enter promo code and below it Join Program and get your own promo code so the affiliates just enter their promo code to see their users and people who are not in the program proceed to join and get their promo code
